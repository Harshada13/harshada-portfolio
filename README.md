## 🧠 About Me

I'm a backend engineer with 3+ years of experience designing and deploying high-performance microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. I specialize in building resilient systems, optimizing database performance, and streamlining CI/CD pipelines. My academic journey includes a Master’s in Computer Science and ongoing graduate studies in Data Science, where I explore predictive modeling and data mining

I enjoy mentoring, collaborating across teams, and blending backend engineering with data-driven insights to build impactful solutions.
